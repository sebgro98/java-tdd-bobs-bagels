## Exercise Requirements

- Use only the Basket class and BasketTest class provided. Later, you'll be building another version of this project using multiple classes together as we learn object-oriented programming.
- You **must** design a domain model before you begin building. Add your model as either a `.md` file or a screenshot
- You **must** use the Red Green Refactor approach to write your code. To demonstrate this, `git commit` after writing your test and commit again after writing the source code to pass it
